## Future Versions

There was a great deal of scope with this project to add extra features.  Given more time I would look into the sort functionality being reversable, so sorting from z-a or from youngest to oldest. 

Other things I would like to work on is the UI, and as I have ideas as to what could be done to make it look more stylish.
